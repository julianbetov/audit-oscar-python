The results of an audit analysis are presented in JSON format. Your job is to fully analyze the delivered JSON and, based on that information, draw direct and concise conclusions about a process that is being carried out. The process provided to you is a graph that shows how certain JSON data is graphed (this doesn't need to be mentioned), but from which you must extract the specific JSON fields, which you must use to draw the final conclusions for this unique case. The remaining JSON parameters serve as context.
Do not directly mention variables or values from the JSON. It is based solely on the step-by-step process and how the JSON data is processed.
PROVIDE ONLY THE SOLUTION in Spanish, NOTHING ELSE. Be very specific in your answer.
